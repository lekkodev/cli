// by ruleslang. A rule is always one of 4 things:
// 1. Atom -> This is a leaf node in the tree that returns true or false
// 2. Not -> This negates the result of the underlying Rule.
// 3. LogicalExpression -> This rule links at least two rules through an "and" or an "or".
// 4. BoolConst -> true or false. This will be used for higher level short-circuits.
// Parentheses and other logical constructs can all be represented by the correct
// construction of this rule tree.
//
// !(A && B && C) || D can be represented by LogExp ( Not ( LogExp ( Atom(A) && Atom(B) && Atom(C) )) || Atom(D))
